# Introduction

This post presents a curated **memory forensics dataset** designed to support research, detection engineering, and hands-on training in the fields of **malware analysis**, **incident response**, and **threat simulation**. The dataset contains memory dumps collected from controlled attack scenarios on Windows 10 systems, covering various techniques such as:

* **Process injection**
* **Credential dumping**
* **Remote access trojans (RATs)**
* **Fileless malware**
* **Cobalt Strike beacons**

Each scenario includes a detailed description, artefacts (e.g., `.mem` files), and relevant attack characteristics such as evasion techniques, persistence indicators, and suspected C2 activity.

The cases range in complexity from unknown infections to targeted Cobalt Strike intrusions, offering varied examples useful for building or testing memory analysis workflows using tools like **Volatility**, **YARA**, and **Malcat**.

Whether you're a student, analyst, or researcher, this resource is intended to provide practical value for learning and advancing your memory forensics capabilities.
